# Coding pattern preferences

- reuse existing code as much as possible
- always prefer simple solutions
- avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas ot eh codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- you are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident 
- keep the codebase very clean and organized
- if we're discussing something, don't implement until commanded to do so

- On any terminal session, always run `poetry shell`
